I &apos;ll have to make enquiries about this subject .
There are so many problems that they need to review the software completely or fix it bit by bit ? ? ? ? ?
What I have a little difficulty understanding , is when we buy the software in question do we becomes the owner and we also have 1 , 2 or 3 years maintenance OR when we get to the end of the subscription we simply cannot use the software unless we pay for more time .
I have no problem to initiate a scan , no problems at all in fact , for the moment everything &apos;s fine
