There is just an image change ( first icon on the left ) but the settings are the same .

Incompatibility NIS 2012 and outlook 2007
I was prompted to download NIS 2012 this morning and since then Outlook 2007 no longer functions correctly , I am unable to insert my word files with the original font .

Hi Liliana _ Gaspar ,
Thank you for your answer .
You have been very clear about your confidence in Symantec as a data security service , that is why I posed the question .

Re : Incorrect renewal .
Hi ,
I have exactly the same problem as seb56 , I am unable to activate the renewal of NORTON ( my key also has only 19 digits instead of 25 ) and my trial period is also 15 days and not 30 days .
Could you enlighten me ?
Hi duduche

Re : Unable to perform the Live Update
You are the 2nd , see this thread .
I think it &apos;s a server problem , what ISP have you got ?
There was this kind of problem twice with Orange and it isn &apos;t them at fault because I have tested .
My Internet service provider is Videotron .
I have updated manually .
I had consulted this thread as well .
I have submitted this request because in my case , the update seems to function normally .
I will wait for the suggested period .
Thank you .
Re : Unable to perform the Live Update
Hi ,
Wait before uninstalling .
Perhaps it will sort itself out on the next restart and / or it is a server problem .

But there was some adware , therefore AdwCleaner has cleared them . Do another ZHPDiag , just to see if AdwCleaner has removed them all .
Good day .
Re : Vulnerability with Norton Online Family .
Hi SAT34,
Thank you for reporting this problem !
I will try to reproduce it on my lab .
We &apos;re talking about the game which you can download on this site ?
And it is therefore the Dofus version installed locally on the PC , I imagine ?
Another important question , what &apos;s the operating system and the version of Norton Online Family ?
Re : Re : Norton 360 Everywhere
Hi lundiossi ,
Norton Everywhere and Norton 360 Premier Edition are not identical .
Checks on your Norton Account that is associated with the product .
In the topic &quot; products &quot; you can see if Norton Everywhere is there and download it .
If in fact you have the wrong product on your account , contact the support so that they can solve the problem ( see the bottom of the page for the chat or phone ) .

Try the following :

Hi nicolarte ,
Yesterday morning ( 25 / 08 / 2012 ) , it was impossible to connect to the Live Update servers .

Re : Site blocked
Hi ,
I can &apos;t follow , I have no message appearing when I open the blocked site .
Here &apos;s the screenshot of the site .
Normally , there is a radio that appears , but since the updates it &apos;s empty , no message .
Otherwise tell me which module to disable in Norton to unblock the site .
Re : Site blocked
I can tell you that the problem appeared after doing the latest Norton updates .
Even for the ID , before I only put my password in once and now I have to do it twice .
Also I &apos;m not great with computers , and I don &apos;t know which modules they are and where I can find them .
Thank you .
Re : Inappropriate message .
Hi GH ,
What type of backup do you do with Norton Ghost ?
How many times a week / month / year are you doing the backup ?
Could you post a screenshot of the message ?
Thank you ,
As Ali said it needs an update of Norton 360 to fix this bug ..
Since this update the task bar for norton 360 seems to have stopped crashing .. for those who see this post , ensure you completely update Norton which will fix this bug .
Note that the Norton task bar will always display the 2012.5.5.11 version , this is normal .

The latest version of Norton Ghost is 15.0.1.36526 .

I can &apos;t where this problem comes from .
But if it is to do with the Framework , you can get a small program that cleans it all up .
And afterwards , we can sort it out using Windows Update or Microsoft Update .
PS ; I have already used it .

In fact , you have installed a patch for service pack 2 .

Re : uKash not detected
Thank you for this link .
Not really very reassuring , it must be said . Roughly this means Norton doesn &apos;t protect against everything .
So if I have a virus then it &apos;s not Norton &apos;s fault because Norton has another tool ( which I don &apos;t have ) that would have found it ...
It is a bit like having an umbrella with a hole in it .
It &apos;s not needed when it &apos;s fine and when it rains we get wet .

Good evening ,
I have just seen the last sentence : Norton is not an anti-virus .
Then here &apos;s a question : Norton protects what ? ? ?
Information regarding the Norton Removal Tool 2013 .
Where can I find the Norton Removal tool 2013 , if there is one ?
Because , as I have already said in another message , NRT asks me to uninstall NIS 2013 before using it .
This morning , my computer has started , but after an automatic Windows update ( I do not know why and I do not know what ) .
In any case , it is working well , and Norton Internet Security is still running .
I hope that it will keep working .
Hi ,
Oh Ok , I didn &apos;t know .
Then concerning the error framework , I have found this for norton 360 .
It says you can try uninstalling Norton with revouninstaller , There is a tutorial here : see parts 1 to 3 .
Re : Norton 360 keeps switching off .
Good evening phildariane ,
After downloading the proprietary tool and uninstalling and reinstalling norton 360 and just before that having verified that I had no other antivirus and all that , I am still at the same place .
Another Idea maybe ?
I am all ears .
Re : Spam

I had the technician intervene this afternoon ... he made some reports and tests ... even with the engine in English ... the problem is still there ...
The data has gone for analysis and I have gone back to NIS 2012 until I get an answer .
Hi , I &apos;ve just got a small solution to add to phildariane &apos;s help . Visit the Norton 360 interface , and run all the updates several times , one after another , until there are none left . I &apos;ll leave phildariane to do the rest !

Re : Install the norton toolbar after its disappearance .

Identity safe blocks Web page
Hi all . For some time I have had some web pages that were blocked , and I found out by accident whilst on the Google Chrome site that it was the identity safe extension which was creating the problem . So I deleted it and now my pc is working well , and they are not blocked anymore .
Does it pose a protection problem for my PC and do you have a solution ?
I reinstalled chrome just to be sure . IE has always worked normally .

There is something new on the US site today at 12.35 p.m. that maybe answers our question , provided that all local versions are launched at the same time .
See :

To be continued .
I have just migrated to NIS 2013 ( v 20.1.1.2 ) .
I have exactly the same problem described by Philozif .
Attached is a a screen shot taken after about 10-15 secs ( the blurring increases second by second ) .

No , the free version is good enough , with one scan per week , it should be fine .

Did you download version 16 or that ? ?
Good evening and thank you .
1 ) The black screen occurred after the restoration .
2 ) 11 tracking cookies have been fixed by the full system scan .
3 ) Norton Power Eraser had been used and did not detect anything before the full system scan .
I am not convinced that the solution lies in the deletion of tracking cookies ...

Re : Several question on Norton Online Family basic and Premier
Hi ,
Can you test this child profile on a PC ?
Just follow the same installation procedures as on a PC , and indicate that your child uses the PC in question .
The aim is to use exactly the same configurations on another device .
I think this could help show that this is potentially a bug .
Internet explorer 9 and identify safe
Hi ,
That is I use internet explorer 9 .
The problem is that when I open my identify safe session , Internet explorer doesn &apos;t respond for about 20 seconds .
Same when norton adds the logins and passwords , you need to wait before clicking but during the installation there are no problems .
Thank you for your wisdom .

Unfortunately it is more complicated for me on my corporate network , I am not an administrator of my PC and the Vista operating system has an additional layer , it is therefore very difficult to know .
How do you contact the SEP Support ?
In any case , I &apos;ve had no more hassles for 2 days with NIS2012 with the singnature in question enabled .

Re : XML scan error appears on Firefox .
The problem started with the latest version of NIS that fixed a bug with Windows XP . ( Norton crash during Liveupdate and others ) ..
I had the previous version before that crashed on one PC and not on the other , and I used FF15 ; Identity Safe worked without problems ..
Yes , after a liveupdate , installing a patch , I &apos;ve got the same problem that I mentioned the 02 November ( first message in the list ) .... My conclusion ; there was a problem that got worse with FF17 but the patch is for the original problem !
( We can nevertheless use the saved logins ) So perhaps there will be a real fix in the coming days ?
And will we get an extra months subscription , to compensate ?
Unexpected deactivation of NIS 2013 .
Hi ,
For the last 4 days , my NIS 2013 disables itself unexpectedly ( Auto-protect , ... ) , the correction doesn &apos;t happen and the manual reactivation does not work .
The only solution I have found is to re-install the product ... but I am not going to do that forever because I still have more than 330 days to run on this product !
What is the solution to deal with this problem once and for all ?

Uninstalling all Norton products and disabling Norton 360 preferences , and reinstalling from Norton Management hasn &apos;t changed anything ... I still cannot activate the online storage centre .
Thank you for your advice .

A file that isn &apos;t run doesn &apos;t present an risk .
There are autorun files , but they are in the initialisation sector , which is scanned automatically when the option is enabled .
In any case , if it reassures you ...
To explain , whilst everything is activated the virus crashes the system hard drive and annihilates the C : drive boot sectors , Personally , I &apos;m not keen to do as if virus weren &apos;t there , if it goes wrong , no one is going to help me . ( ? )

Re : Disconnect an external drive
I have re-read my reply and I wonder if the following was clear : The uninstall was just to confirm that the problem comes from NIS , it wasn &apos;t a solution in itself .
I can do other research but as far as troubleshooting is concerned , if we can start by proving that the problem comes from the antivirus we would know if it is worthwhile continuing along this path .

Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : XML parsing error appears on Firefox
Firefox or Norton ! Is that the question ? This problem doesn &apos;t exist with the first version of NIS 2013 and Firefox 15 or 16 .

Where does the error come from ?
Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : XML parsing error appears on Firefox
I find it unbelievable ! Compensation shouldn &apos;t have to be asked for . Norton customer service should have automatically offered it to it &apos;s customers with this problem . It is not for Firefox to adapt to Norton but Norton which should adapt to a change in Firefox !

Re : Problem with connection to the Symantec site .
Good evening ,
Good evening Michel _ 1108,
If all goes well , I think that it shouldn &apos;t be much longer to wait for the patch ( I can &apos;t promise anything though ) .
Meanwhile , I have found this post from another client that had found a way to copy / paste from word which seemed to resolve a similar problem to yours : Intermittent problem with recognition of Identity Safe password .
Have a great evening ,
Re : The Norton toolbar in my Google web browser has disappeared .
The Norton Identity Protection 2013.2.0.18 module extension just appeared this morning , as if by magic , in the Google Chrome settings interface .
A Liveupdate of NIS has corrected this .
Therefore issue resolved .
If the problem reappears , I will definitely let you know .
Good day .
Agreed , I understand a little better .
Yes I hope that this will soon be available on mobile phones .
Thank you for your response and your help .
Good day .
Hi michelros ,

I have this problem as well ...
The optimisation goes directly onto the B disk ... which doesn &apos;t exist !

Re : Computer freezing
Hi , I have disabled the Norton modules as suggested and will let you know how things progress .
There is however an important detail in my computer freezing problem that differs from the computer freeze referred to in Liliana &apos;s solution .

Re : Blue screen caused by SYMEFA.SYS in WIN XP
This problem does come from Norton .
I have to restart in my XP sp3 in safe mode .
Delete the files &quot; Symefa &quot; and Magic , after that no more problems .
I then reinstall Norton and get an alert on the file SYMEFA.SYS and the blue screen .
For professional reasons I can &apos;t work with a PC that goes wrong .
I hope that this problem can be resolved because otherwise I have no other choice than to use the competition .

Could you tell me if this latest version integrates compatibility with the anti-spam module for Outlook 2013 ?
I am going to proceed with the update in a few hours .

Re : Belgian Subscription renewal in French .
Hi euromad ,
Thank you for your reply .
We are analysing these cases to try and stop the problem from happening again .
It would therefore be very useful to have examples of product serial numbers .
Could you send me a private message with yours ?
Thank you and good day
Re : Problems win xp
Hi .
A little late : No worries for your Norton subscription .
Go in your Norton Account ( www.mynortonaccount.com / ) once you &apos;ve fixed your computer problem .
You can reinstall them then .
Good luck with your PC ...
Re : How to go from Norton 360 premier to Norton antivirus .
Hi ,
A Norton 360 key does not work for Norton antivirus .
But if you have a Norton antivirus key , simply uninstall Norton 360 and then install Norton antivirus .
Re : Patch 20.3.0.36 not received
Updates suspended ... initially .
So if the update doesn &apos;t work , don &apos;t worry , it will come in due course .
Re : Patch 20.3.0.36 not received
Hi chefo ,
As Kasou mentioned in his message above , some of us may need to do a new installation , to benefit from the latest version : 20.3.0.36 .
Personally this was my case .
Furthermore , for your information . I do not usually write or respond without thinking : I re-read the post dedicated to this update before answering .

Re : Norton toolbar
Apparently your Norton bar is enabled in &quot; Firefox &quot; ( orange box top left ) &gt; Complementary modules ) .
However , have you verified that the toolbar is configured to be displayed under Firefox .
To do that , go to &quot; Firefox ( orange box top left ) &gt; &gt; Options &quot;
And check that Norton toolbar is ticked .
Did it fix it your problem ?
Sincerely
Guillaume1024
Re : Norton toolbar
PS : I am surprised by the version number of your Norton Toolbar .
What Norton product are you using ?
What is your Operating System ?
Re : Patch 20.3.0.36 not received
Hi ,
I &apos;d like to point out that I wasn &apos;t saying anything , my question was just to find out where you saw it , that &apos;s all .
That is precisely why I asked this , because I think it is strange that they ask to uninstall a product for a patch .
It was nothing have with you , or anyone else other , except Norton technicians .

Re : NIS 2013 and task manager .
Hi JeanDeNice
I tested the task manager with W7 and NIS 2013 on a virtual machine without any problem .
I also installed Glary Utilities and launched the manager without problem .
I can also use Task Manager on other machines with other configurations .
Do you have access to other computers with Windows 7 and NIS 2013 to make a comparison ?
Thank you and good day ,
Re : IE6 and Norton Internet Security
Good evening .
I had IE9 ... no problem .
Otherwise , we have computers at the municipal library for example ... perhaps you too ?
Or perhaps friends , work ?
Otherwise there is certainly a phone number for Norton somewhere ...
Re : IE6 and Norton Internet Security
You are taking enormous security risks using a terrible old outdated browser .
There is no point in having Norton on your machine as it &apos;s got more holes that swiss cheese .
Do your windows updates and the browser as well !
Should I have the 2012 ?
Would it help ?
Re : IE6 and Norton Internet Security

For my part , I don &apos;t have any problems with the Windows task manager , but I managed to reproduce the problem with Glary Utilities .
I will open case to ask for the matter to be investigated .

Hi delph ,
It &apos;s funny how getting onto the site and subscribing works okay but for the opt-out things are a lot more complicated .

I don &apos;t dare believe it ... )
Thank you for the tips , I &apos;ll try and get most out of them .
Where did you find the phone number ?
Re : IE6 and Norton Internet Security
Good evening .
When the form is not available , therefore outside chat hours .
Bottom Right , they give local numbers .

Re : License Renewal 1 PC

Transition from NIS to Norton 360 ( remaining subscription days .. ! )

Good day ..... Sincerely .

Re : Problem with norton toolbar and Identity Safe
Good evening ,
Damn , I had forgotten that you had N360 and not NIS ..
Try and go into &quot; my Network &quot; and then &quot; identity protection &quot; , there should be an equivalent !
On the other hand , on chrome , does the Norton logo appear like I said on my other message .

Re : Unresolved support problem .

But if the virus has been blocked , your machine is secure !
I would advise you to wait , perhaps an update will resolve the issue .
In the meantime , you could try a launching a live-update manually !

I &apos;ve only got that on the network , Lol .
Otherwise , on chrome I don &apos;t have the logo because as I said this morning the toolbar has disappeared and the icon with it .

Satisfaction with NORTON by Symantec 360
Hi , I &apos;ll put in my two penny worth , Norton is improving over the years , this means that we can rely on quality products , It &apos;s a paid product but the results are evident , and as we also have a community forum dedicated to Norton by Symantec , we &apos;re not short of opportunities for additional help .

Thank you Guillaume1024 !
Purchase of Symantec System Recovery 2013 .
If I understand correctly , we can opt for a 1 , 2 or 3 year maintenance package. either in essential or basic mode .
What I have a little difficulty understanding , is when we buy the software in question do we becomes the owner and we also have 1 , 2 or 3 years maintenance OR when we get to the end of the subscription we simply cannot use the software unless we pay for more time .
Thank you for clarifying this point .
And you don &apos;t want to another scan other than Norton ?

Hi ,
We have an case open with Microsoft to help resolve the problem .
We unfortunately have no control over the solution in this case , as it doesn &apos;t come from Norton .
But as long as Norton is showing green it &apos;s working 100 % .
It is an error from Windows 8 Security Center .

Could you execute LiveUpdates manually until it shows that there are no more updates available and then retest ?

I see that in the meantime you found a solution .
I had asked to retest today because a small patch was distributed via LiveUpdate after your last post and I wanted to see how effective it was .
Thank you in any case and all the best !

To avoid the vagaries of the product validation and to draw the attention of Norton engineers to possibly making the NRnR.exe tool better .
