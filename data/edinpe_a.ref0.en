Re : Failed backup to CD / DVD since the 08 / 01 / 2012
Hi caline _ 64,
Have you been able to perform a backup to DVD ?
If not , can you send us the error message ?

And possibly describe the steps performed , so that members of the Norton Community can also share their opinion .
Thank you ,
Re : New version of Norton ?
These tasks in grey do not appear in the NIS version 19.2.0.10 .
I think that these are maintenance tasks which we do not have access to because they are unique to the programme .
I will ask the Support .
With regards to the Toolbar , what other additional icon ?
Just an image change ( first icon on the left ) but the settings are the same .

Re : Error 3048,3
Wait for 48 hours .
From time to time execute a manual LiveUpdate and we will see at each restart of the PC .
It is not impossible that this comes from Symantec servers which are overloaded or are undergoing maintenance for LiveUpdate .
There are currently problems to dispatch the last update .
Do not fear , you are always protected .
Please let us know if the problem persists .

I work with Windows XP .
I have applied the proposed approach but without success .
Finally , it was the Symantec hotline who found the answer : The setting &quot; Smart Definitions &quot; was disabled ( however I never touched it ) !

Therefore it &apos;s rubbish .
The true email by Norton have no link to payment and simply mention that it will be a direct debit and then once the direct debit has been done a new email tells you that the automatic transfer has happened .

We can also accept to download them , to keep them up to date , this will not interfere with the operation of NIS

Re : Windows Defender compatible with NIS 2012 ?
In fact , the path to access to the service and :

Hi Liliana _ Gaspar ,
Thank you for your answer .
You have been very clear and you &apos;ve trusted Symantec in terms of data security , that is why I asked the question .
It would be quite practical but it is true that it take more servers .
Perhaps one day ...
Re : Renewal Incorrect
Hi ,
I have exactly the same problem as seb56 , unable to activate my Norton renewal Subscription ( my key only includes 19 digits instead of 25 ) and my trial period is also of 15 days and not 30 days .
Could you shed some light on this ?
Hi duduche
Unfortunately I can only refer you to the Support , see link above .
No fear , everything will be sorted and your current version is fully functional .
Please keep me updated .
Re : Unable to perform the Live Update
You are the 2nd , see this subject .
I am thinking of a server problem , what ISP do you have ?
Twice this kind of problem with Orange came up and they are not at fault because I have ran tests .
My Internet service provider is Vidéotron .
I have updated manually .
I had consulted this subject also .
I have submitted this request because in my case , the update seems to function normally .
I am expecting the deadline suggested .
Thank you .
Re : Unable to perform the Live Update
Hi ,
Waits before uninstalling .
Perhaps it will sort itself out during the next restart and / or it is a server problem .

Good evening Augustus ,
I did exactly what you recommend and nothing has worked . The only difference : from the beginning of the full scan , the scan starts at 49,650 ... files . The scan worked for 5 hours , without stopping .
Do you have any other solutions that I could apply ?
Thank you in advance ,

Re : Ghost ( of Systemworks 2006 ) no longer wants to create a recovery point ( Windows XP SP3 )
Hi , it &apos;s very simple , the backup file is in the form of a temporary file in the C drive , then this file is transformed into backup image on the target disk .
There is enough room for this step in the C drive . More than 32 there is a limit to the size of the files .
Hs : Softwares that you are using are out of date , update to the latest versions .
In CCleaner there are three columns : Problem - Data - Registry Key

Re : Problem opening NIS 2012

A program patch has been distributed .

Re : Outgoing message cleared
Yes , I had this message , which has not been useful ; my message was erased .
I had of course read the message having same issue .
This is the first time that NIS intervenes for this .
It is unlikely that I have never made a mistake .
I have disabled NIS for outgoing messages ; if there is another anomaly , I shall not see it .
Thank you for your help in any case .

Hi , can someone tell me what is the email address when I should send the proof of product purchase because I have lost the paper with the activation code .
When running C cleaner it shoes : In registry error
Ref MUI missing C program files norton antivirus engine 19.6.2.10 Hst.exe ccSv
Would this have an influence on my problem ?
Hi ,
For my part I find it odd , it &apos;s twice now that I have an email problem with Norton .
Although it is different for me , a norton update has created the problem somewhere .
Because it happening twice in such little time is a little odd .
&lt; URL &gt;
Yes I read ( Message outbound cleared ) .
What I wanted to say is that it &apos;s already twice this has happened in such little time ! While before no , or there is a problem with norton and email .
To see follows this
Download Adwcleaner
Launche the program adwcleaner.exe located on your Desktop . ( User of Vista / Windows 7 , clique-right on File - &gt; Run as administrator )
On the main menu , click Remove and wait for the scan
After the scan , a AdwCleaner.txt report opens .
Norton Utilities Version 15.0 , only downloads as trial version for 30 days
I downloaded Norton Internet Security , for him , it is OK .
At the same time , I have checked the box of Norton utilities version 15 , by setting the settings as asked . I was only able to download the trial version of 30 days . Is this normal , if not , what must it do ?
Please answer me , if another setting is necessary , how much is it ?

Good evening ,
Contact the Support through the live Chat , tell them your dad &apos;s order number , there won &apos;t be any problem , they have access to your account .
It is a Norton update , I have Windows 7 , the NIS interface that allows full control of the antivirus does not open , instead I receive the error message which then sends me the Technical Support link which does not open either
Re : Norton internet security 2012
I have uninstalled and then reinstalled the virus using the tools requested but the control interface does not always appear ,
I have checked my version and it is the latest , I have tried detailed network scan and I receive a message of internal program error , at the end of the installation of NIS I receive a message saying that my system is now protected but I have no access to the interface

I see no configuration setting .
It seems that when updating Norton has reactivated ( check ) the viewing gadgets on the desktop .

I will uninstall it in the hope that my Norton 360 will remain functional without this gadget !
