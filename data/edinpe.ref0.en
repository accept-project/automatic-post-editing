Re : Failed backup to CD / DVD since the 08 / 01 / 2012
Hi caline _ 64,
Have you been able to perform a backup to DVD ?
If not , can you send us the error message ?

And possibly describe the steps performed , so that members of the Norton Community can also share their opinion .
Thank you ,
Re : New version of Norton ?
These tasks in grey do not appear in the NIS version 19.2.0.10 .
I think that these are maintenance tasks which we do not have access to because they are unique to the programme .
I will ask the Support .
With regards to the Toolbar , what other additional icon ?
Just an image change ( first icon on the left ) but the settings are the same .

Re : Error 3048,3
Wait for 48 hours .
From time to time execute a manual LiveUpdate and we will see at each restart of the PC .
It is not impossible that this comes from Symantec servers which are overloaded or are undergoing maintenance for LiveUpdate .
There are currently problems to dispatch the last update .
Do not fear , you are always protected .
Please let us know if the problem persists .

I work with Windows XP .
I have applied the proposed approach but without success .
Finally , it was the Symantec hotline who found the answer : The setting &quot; Smart Definitions &quot; was disabled ( however I never touched it ) !

Therefore it &apos;s rubbish .
The true email by Norton have no link to payment and simply mention that it will be a direct debit and then once the direct debit has been done a new email tells you that the automatic transfer has happened .

We can also accept to download them , to keep them up to date , this will not interfere with the operation of NIS

In fact , the path to access to the service and :

Hi Liliana _ Gaspar ,
Thank you for your answer .
You have been very clear and you &apos;ve trusted Symantec in terms of data security , that is why I asked the question .

Re : Renewal Incorrect
Hi ,
I have exactly the same problem as seb56 , unable to activate my Norton renewal Subscription ( my key only includes 19 digits instead of 25 ) and my trial period is also of 15 days and not 30 days .
Could you shed some light on this ?
Hi duduche
Unfortunately I can only refer you to the Support , see link above .
No fear , everything will be sorted and your current version is fully functional .
Please keep me updated .
Re : Unable to perform the Live Update
You are the 2nd , see this subject .
I am thinking of a server problem , what ISP do you have ?
Twice this kind of problem with Orange came up and they are not at fault because I have ran tests .
My Internet service provider is Vidéotron .
I have updated manually .
I had consulted this subject also .
I have submitted this request because in my case , the update seems to function normally .
I am expecting the deadline suggested .
Thank you .
Re : Unable to perform the Live Update

Perhaps it will sort itself out during the next restart and / or it is a server problem .

Good evening Augustus ,

Re : Ghost ( of Systemworks 2006 ) no longer wants to create a recovery point ( Windows XP SP3 )
Hi , it &apos;s very simple , the backup file is in the form of a temporary file in the C drive , then this file is transformed into backup image on the target disk .
There is enough room for this step in the C drive . More than 32 there is a limit to the size of the files .

Re : Outgoing message cleared
Yes , I had this message , which has not been useful ; my message was erased .

I have disabled NIS for outgoing messages ; if there is another anomaly , I shall not see it .

Would this have an influence on my problem ?
Hi ,
For my part I find it odd , it &apos;s twice now that I have an email problem with Norton .
Although it is different for me , a norton update has created the problem somewhere .
Because it happening twice in such little time is a little odd .

Yes I read ( Message outbound cleared ) .
What I wanted to say is that it &apos;s already twice this has happened in such little time ! While before no , or there is a problem with norton and email .

Hi Liliana ,

Another idea ?
( I have Win 7 64 Bit )
Thank you . ﻿
Hi Lettrephi ,
Try as follows :
Start up using the Ghost CD Recovery and select &quot; Start network driver &quot; from the menu .
You will have to choose the driver of Windows Vista 32-bit .
At the moment you are trying to use the NT driver , which will not work .
When the good drivers will be launched , you will then be able to access your network and NAS .

The N360 key is not valid for NIS .
If you still have a valid key for NIS , you can uninstall N360 and reinstall NIS .
If you turn off the backup , the computer is still slow ?
N360 is more comprehensive software that NIS , I think the best is to try to resolve the problem so you can benefit from the investment already made .

How many times a week / month / year are you running the backup ?
Could you post screen shots of the message ?
Thank you ,
Indeed as Ali said it needed a update in norton 360 to set this bug ..
Therefore since this update the bar for norton 360 seems to no longer crash .. ; P for those who will see this post ensure you update your norton completely which will fix this bug with the future users ..
Note that the norton bar will display always 2012.5.5.11 version which is normal
Re : Back to NIS 2013

Norton Confidential ( Mac )
Hi ,
My problem is minor , but I prefer to talk about it : Norton Confidential is not compatible with the latest version of Firefox .

Will there be a patch ?

Re : Have Norton Online Family
Good evening ,
If it is admin account , it is normal that it can stop the process .
I would advise you to move it into a limited account and manually authorise yourself as you go along .
Hello to you .
I do not see the root of this problem
But if it is a problem regarding Framework , there is a small software that cleans all .
And after , with Windows Update or Microsoft Update , they restore it in the right order .
Ps ; I have already used it of course .
Here attached ...
In fact , you have installed a patch service pack 2 .
And I see that there is also a patch service pack 3 .

Hi jnq ,
Is the external drive available with Windows Explorer ?
Could you try to run the backup on a drive USB 2.0 instead of USB 3.0 to check if the problem is due to compatibility ?
Please confirm the results of backup .
Re : UKash not detected
Thank you for this link .
Not really reassuring , this means , overall , I have a Norton which isn &apos;t protecting against everything .
So if I have a virus it is not Norton &apos;s fault because Norton has another tool ( which I did not ) who is in charge of that ...
It is a bit like having an umbrella with holes .
It isn &apos;t useful when it &apos;s sunny , and when it rains you get wet .

Must I again get a license dedicated to this new pc or is it possible to upgrade the license for 1 pc to 1 license for 3 ?
Re : Problems NIS 2013 ?
Phildariane good evening , I have also windows xp sp3 and I have no other anti virus that norton installed on my PC .
In order to avoid that Norton malfunctions as I explained in my previous messages , I had to disable Norton AntiSpam , and liveupdate , I have just left the automatic updates
Spam
I have just subscribed to NORTON INTERNET SECURITY because I have been a victim of SPAM .
My LIVE mailing was pirated , my whole contact list has received a message with a link belonging to a commercial site ( selling Viagra ) .

Re : Problems NIS 2013 ?
When I also open outlook to try to check my messages ( the messages take too long and do not complete and it is the bug ) , it also makes NIS 2013 disappear ( a window opens symantec corporation or something of this kind appears when it encounters problems ) and I am obliged to restart my pc .
NIS blocks a process ... CONHOST.EXE

Information on Norton Removal Tool 2013
Where can I find the norton removal tool 2013 , if there is any ?
Because as I have already said in another message , NRT asks first to uninstall NIS 2013 before use .
This morning , the pc endpoint started , but after an automatic update of Windows ( I do not know why and I do not know for what ) .
In any case , it is working well , and Norton Internet Security is always running .
I hope that it will last .

Internet connection problem and Norton Installation
Hi ,
I installed Norton on 3rd October on the PC , operating system windows 7 and since I can no longer connect to the network at all ( &apos; through firefox , internet explorer or any other site or search engine ) .
Are there any settings automatically modified from the installation which could cause this problem ?
Thank you .

Re : invisible Disk
Hi ,
It seems that your problem is different from the one I had mentioned .
The procedures for Norton Ghost are a bit complex .
Do you want to call the Technical Support directly so that they can check ?

Hi , You are not the only user in this case ; Many people complain that there are bugs of NIS 2013 on PCs with XP .

Re : Several questions on Norton Online Family basic and premier
Hi ,
Do you have the opportunity to test this child profile on a PC ?
Just follow the same installation procedures on a PC , and indicate that your child connects to the PC in question .
The aim is to use exactly the same configurations on to another device .
I think this could help to show that this is potentially a bug .
Internet explorer 9 and identify safe
Hi ,
Yes , I use internet explorer 9 .
The problem is that when I open my identify safe session , internet explorer does not respond for 20 seconds .

Re : XML scan error appears on Firefox
The problem is apparent with the latest version of NIS , that corrected a bug with Windows XP . ( Norton crashing when performing Live update and others ) ..
Before I had the previous version ( buggait crash ) on a PC and not on the other , and I used FF15 ; Identity Safe will worked without a problem ..
Indeed , after a live update , installing a patch , I returned to the problem mentioned on 2nd November ( first message of the list ) .... conclusion , there was a problem ; it became worse with FF17 but the patch is the underlying problem !
( I can nevertheless use the saved logins ) So perhaps there will be a proper correction in the coming days ?
And will we have and additional month &apos;s subscription , as compensation ?

I have re-read my reply and I wonder if the following was clear : uninstalling would be just to confirm that the problem comes from NIS , not as a solution .

Firefox or norton ! Is that the question ? This problem does not exist with the first version of NIS 2013 and Firefox 15 or 16. when the version NIS 2013 shipped end October , that corrected the PB of windows xp ( crash of Norton in various which LiveUpdate uses of Nis ) , PB appeared on Firefox 15 and what followed .
Where does the error come from ?

There is however an important detail in my problem of freezing computer that differs from computer freeze which Liliana &apos;s solution refers to .
Not so much , only when I &apos;m on the internet that the freezing occurs , rather when I I use Windows Live Mail to send or receive my emails .

Site blocked by Norton
Hi ,
One of my customers has seen their site taken off line a weeks ago , by OVH , due to a hack .
I managed to get online today , www.saisonsduchangement.com except that since his computer ( which I did not access but I can ask for info if you need it ) , it cannot always not access the site because Norton blocks it .
What is the procedure ?
Thank you for your help and good day

Re : Blue screen because of SYMEFA.SYS under WIN XP
This problem comes from Norton

I cannot for professional reasons work with a PC that crashes .
I hope that this problem is resolved because I have no other choice but to you competitor

Of after what I understand we can opt for 1 , 2 or 3 years maintenance essential mode or Basic .
What I have a some difficulty understanding that when we will buy the software in question it becomes the owner and we have 1 to 2 or 3 years maintenance OR to the output of this subscription simply cannot use software except for repayment for a new period of time ?
Thank you for clarifying this point .
And you do not want to run a scan other than Norton &apos;s ?
But the others believe that this may not be worth it ..

Hi ,
We have an open case from Microsoft so the problem can be resolved .
In this case , we unfortunately do not have control over the resolution as it is not Norton &apos;s .
However as soon as Norton goes green , the product works 100 % .
It is an error of Windows Security Centre 8 .
