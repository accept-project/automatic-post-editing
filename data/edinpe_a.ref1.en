There is just an image change ( first icon on the left ) but the settings are the same .

Incompatibility NIS 2012 and outlook 2007
I was prompted to download NIS 2012 this morning and since then Outlook 2007 no longer functions correctly , I am unable to insert my word files with the original font .

Hi Liliana _ Gaspar ,
Thank you for your answer .
You have been very clear about your confidence in Symantec as a data security service , that is why I posed the question .
It would be practical , but it &apos;s true that it would take even more servers .
Perhaps one day ...
Re : Incorrect renewal .
Hi ,
I have exactly the same problem as seb56 , I am unable to activate the renewal of NORTON ( my key also has only 19 digits instead of 25 ) and my trial period is also 15 days and not 30 days .
Could you enlighten me ?
Hi duduche
Unfortunately I can only refer you to the Support , see the link above .
Don &apos;t worry , everything will sort itself out and your current version is fully functional .

Re : Unable to perform the Live Update
You are the 2nd , see this thread .
I think it &apos;s a server problem , what ISP have you got ?
There was this kind of problem twice with Orange and it isn &apos;t them at fault because I have tested .
My Internet service provider is Videotron .
I have updated manually .
I had consulted this thread as well .
I have submitted this request because in my case , the update seems to function normally .
I will wait for the suggested period .
Thank you .
Re : Unable to perform the Live Update
Hi ,
Wait before uninstalling .
Perhaps it will sort itself out on the next restart and / or it is a server problem .

Hi ,
For my part I find it odd , this is the second time we &apos;ve had an email problem with norton .
Although it &apos;s different for me , a Norton update must have put the problem somewhere .
Because twice in a short space of time is bizarre .
&lt; URL &gt;

What want I say is that it &apos;s now happened twice in a short space of time ! whereas it didn &apos;t happen before , or there is a problem with norton and email .
To see follow this
Download adwcleaner
Launch the program adwcleaner.exe located on your desktop . ( Vista user / Windows 7 , right click on File - &gt; Run as administrator )

After the scan , a report AdwCleaner.txt opens .

You can restore the deleted files , look in &quot; Recover &quot; .

Re : How do you remove the desktop gadget ?
Hi ,
I can &apos;t see any configuration settings .
It seems that whilst updating , Norton reactivated ( or ticked ) the &quot; view desktop gadgets &quot; .

Hey presto !
When Windows starts , the Norton gadget still appears !
I will uninstall it in the hope that my Norton 360 will still work without this gadget !
