1 ) The black screen occurred after the restore .
2 ) 11 tracking cookies have been resolved by the full system scan .
3 ) Norton Power Eraser had been used and did not detect anything before the full system scan .
I am not convinced that the solution lies in the deletion of tracking cookies ...

It may be that this problem of black screen is linked to the graphics card and its drivers .
