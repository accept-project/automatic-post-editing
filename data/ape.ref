Re : Failed backup to CD / DVD since the 08 / 01 / 2012
Hi caline _ 64,
Have you been able to perform a backup to DVD ?
If not , can you send us the error message ?

And possibly describe the steps performed , so that members of the Norton Community can also share their opinion .
Thank you ,
Re : New version of Norton ?
These tasks in grey do not appear in the NIS version 19.2.0.10 .
I think that these are maintenance tasks which we do not have access to because they are unique to the programme .
I will ask the Support .
With regards to the Toolbar , what other additional icon ?
Just an image change ( first icon on the left ) but the settings are the same .

Re : Error 3048,3
Wait for 48 hours .
From time to time execute a manual LiveUpdate and we will see at each restart of the PC .
It is not impossible that this comes from Symantec servers which are overloaded or are undergoing maintenance for LiveUpdate .
There are currently problems to dispatch the last update .
Do not fear , you are always protected .
Please let us know if the problem persists .

I work with Windows XP .
I have applied the proposed approach but without success .
Finally , it was the Symantec hotline who found the answer : The setting &quot; Smart Definitions &quot; was disabled ( however I never touched it ) !

Therefore it &apos;s rubbish .
The true email by Norton have no link to payment and simply mention that it will be a direct debit and then once the direct debit has been done a new email tells you that the automatic transfer has happened .

We can also accept to download them , to keep them up to date , this will not interfere with the operation of NIS

In fact , the path to access to the service and :

Hi Liliana _ Gaspar ,
Thank you for your answer .
You have been very clear and you &apos;ve trusted Symantec in terms of data security , that is why I asked the question .

Re : Renewal Incorrect
Hi ,
I have exactly the same problem as seb56 , unable to activate my Norton renewal Subscription ( my key only includes 19 digits instead of 25 ) and my trial period is also of 15 days and not 30 days .
Could you shed some light on this ?
Hi duduche
Unfortunately I can only refer you to the Support , see link above .
No fear , everything will be sorted and your current version is fully functional .
Please keep me updated .
Re : Unable to perform the Live Update
You are the 2nd , see this subject .
I am thinking of a server problem , what ISP do you have ?
Twice this kind of problem with Orange came up and they are not at fault because I have ran tests .
My Internet service provider is Vidéotron .
I have updated manually .
I had consulted this subject also .
I have submitted this request because in my case , the update seems to function normally .
I am expecting the deadline suggested .
Thank you .
Re : Unable to perform the Live Update

Perhaps it will sort itself out during the next restart and / or it is a server problem .

Good evening Augustus ,

Re : Ghost ( of Systemworks 2006 ) no longer wants to create a recovery point ( Windows XP SP3 )
Hi , it &apos;s very simple , the backup file is in the form of a temporary file in the C drive , then this file is transformed into backup image on the target disk .
There is enough room for this step in the C drive . More than 32 there is a limit to the size of the files .

Re : Outgoing message cleared
Yes , I had this message , which has not been useful ; my message was erased .

I have disabled NIS for outgoing messages ; if there is another anomaly , I shall not see it .

Would this have an influence on my problem ?
Hi ,
For my part I find it odd , it &apos;s twice now that I have an email problem with Norton .
Although it is different for me , a norton update has created the problem somewhere .
Because it happening twice in such little time is a little odd .

Yes I read ( Message outbound cleared ) .
What I wanted to say is that it &apos;s already twice this has happened in such little time ! While before no , or there is a problem with norton and email .

Hi Liliana ,

Another idea ?
( I have Win 7 64 Bit )
Thank you . ﻿
Hi Lettrephi ,
Try as follows :
Start up using the Ghost CD Recovery and select &quot; Start network driver &quot; from the menu .
You will have to choose the driver of Windows Vista 32-bit .
At the moment you are trying to use the NT driver , which will not work .
When the good drivers will be launched , you will then be able to access your network and NAS .

The N360 key is not valid for NIS .
If you still have a valid key for NIS , you can uninstall N360 and reinstall NIS .
If you turn off the backup , the computer is still slow ?
N360 is more comprehensive software that NIS , I think the best is to try to resolve the problem so you can benefit from the investment already made .

How many times a week / month / year are you running the backup ?
Could you post screen shots of the message ?
Thank you ,
Indeed as Ali said it needed a update in norton 360 to set this bug ..
Therefore since this update the bar for norton 360 seems to no longer crash .. ; P for those who will see this post ensure you update your norton completely which will fix this bug with the future users ..
Note that the norton bar will display always 2012.5.5.11 version which is normal
Re : Back to NIS 2013

Norton Confidential ( Mac )
Hi ,
My problem is minor , but I prefer to talk about it : Norton Confidential is not compatible with the latest version of Firefox .

Will there be a patch ?

Re : Have Norton Online Family
Good evening ,
If it is admin account , it is normal that it can stop the process .
I would advise you to move it into a limited account and manually authorise yourself as you go along .
Hello to you .
I do not see the root of this problem
But if it is a problem regarding Framework , there is a small software that cleans all .
And after , with Windows Update or Microsoft Update , they restore it in the right order .
Ps ; I have already used it of course .
Here attached ...
In fact , you have installed a patch service pack 2 .
And I see that there is also a patch service pack 3 .

Hi jnq ,
Is the external drive available with Windows Explorer ?
Could you try to run the backup on a drive USB 2.0 instead of USB 3.0 to check if the problem is due to compatibility ?
Please confirm the results of backup .
Re : UKash not detected
Thank you for this link .
Not really reassuring , this means , overall , I have a Norton which isn &apos;t protecting against everything .
So if I have a virus it is not Norton &apos;s fault because Norton has another tool ( which I did not ) who is in charge of that ...
It is a bit like having an umbrella with holes .
It isn &apos;t useful when it &apos;s sunny , and when it rains you get wet .

Must I again get a license dedicated to this new pc or is it possible to upgrade the license for 1 pc to 1 license for 3 ?
Re : Problems NIS 2013 ?
Phildariane good evening , I have also windows xp sp3 and I have no other anti virus that norton installed on my PC .
In order to avoid that Norton malfunctions as I explained in my previous messages , I had to disable Norton AntiSpam , and liveupdate , I have just left the automatic updates
Spam
I have just subscribed to NORTON INTERNET SECURITY because I have been a victim of SPAM .
My LIVE mailing was pirated , my whole contact list has received a message with a link belonging to a commercial site ( selling Viagra ) .

Re : Problems NIS 2013 ?
When I also open outlook to try to check my messages ( the messages take too long and do not complete and it is the bug ) , it also makes NIS 2013 disappear ( a window opens symantec corporation or something of this kind appears when it encounters problems ) and I am obliged to restart my pc .
NIS blocks a process ... CONHOST.EXE

Information on Norton Removal Tool 2013
Where can I find the norton removal tool 2013 , if there is any ?
Because as I have already said in another message , NRT asks first to uninstall NIS 2013 before use .
This morning , the pc endpoint started , but after an automatic update of Windows ( I do not know why and I do not know for what ) .
In any case , it is working well , and Norton Internet Security is always running .
I hope that it will last .

Internet connection problem and Norton Installation
Hi ,
I installed Norton on 3rd October on the PC , operating system windows 7 and since I can no longer connect to the network at all ( &apos; through firefox , internet explorer or any other site or search engine ) .
Are there any settings automatically modified from the installation which could cause this problem ?
Thank you .

Re : invisible Disk
Hi ,
It seems that your problem is different from the one I had mentioned .
The procedures for Norton Ghost are a bit complex .
Do you want to call the Technical Support directly so that they can check ?

Hi , You are not the only user in this case ; Many people complain that there are bugs of NIS 2013 on PCs with XP .

Re : Several questions on Norton Online Family basic and premier
Hi ,
Do you have the opportunity to test this child profile on a PC ?
Just follow the same installation procedures on a PC , and indicate that your child connects to the PC in question .
The aim is to use exactly the same configurations on to another device .
I think this could help to show that this is potentially a bug .
Internet explorer 9 and identify safe
Hi ,
Yes , I use internet explorer 9 .
The problem is that when I open my identify safe session , internet explorer does not respond for 20 seconds .

Re : XML scan error appears on Firefox
The problem is apparent with the latest version of NIS , that corrected a bug with Windows XP . ( Norton crashing when performing Live update and others ) ..
Before I had the previous version ( buggait crash ) on a PC and not on the other , and I used FF15 ; Identity Safe will worked without a problem ..
Indeed , after a live update , installing a patch , I returned to the problem mentioned on 2nd November ( first message of the list ) .... conclusion , there was a problem ; it became worse with FF17 but the patch is the underlying problem !
( I can nevertheless use the saved logins ) So perhaps there will be a proper correction in the coming days ?
And will we have and additional month &apos;s subscription , as compensation ?

I have re-read my reply and I wonder if the following was clear : uninstalling would be just to confirm that the problem comes from NIS , not as a solution .

Firefox or norton ! Is that the question ? This problem does not exist with the first version of NIS 2013 and Firefox 15 or 16. when the version NIS 2013 shipped end October , that corrected the PB of windows xp ( crash of Norton in various which LiveUpdate uses of Nis ) , PB appeared on Firefox 15 and what followed .
Where does the error come from ?

There is however an important detail in my problem of freezing computer that differs from computer freeze which Liliana &apos;s solution refers to .
Not so much , only when I &apos;m on the internet that the freezing occurs , rather when I I use Windows Live Mail to send or receive my emails .

Site blocked by Norton
Hi ,
One of my customers has seen their site taken off line a weeks ago , by OVH , due to a hack .
I managed to get online today , www.saisonsduchangement.com except that since his computer ( which I did not access but I can ask for info if you need it ) , it cannot always not access the site because Norton blocks it .
What is the procedure ?
Thank you for your help and good day

Re : Blue screen because of SYMEFA.SYS under WIN XP
This problem comes from Norton

I cannot for professional reasons work with a PC that crashes .
I hope that this problem is resolved because I have no other choice but to you competitor

Of after what I understand we can opt for 1 , 2 or 3 years maintenance essential mode or Basic .
What I have a some difficulty understanding that when we will buy the software in question it becomes the owner and we have 1 to 2 or 3 years maintenance OR to the output of this subscription simply cannot use software except for repayment for a new period of time ?
Thank you for clarifying this point .
And you do not want to run a scan other than Norton &apos;s ?
But the others believe that this may not be worth it ..

Am I the only one to see that since this version , the Insight Optimiser ( hard disk defragmentation ) in the Norton tasks doesn &apos;t work any more ?
Even trying to turn it on manually it lasts 2 or 3 seconds and nothing is done .

Re : Update Ghost 15
I had to uninstall Norton Ghost 15 .
I had on it on my laptop for several months and now I have a blue screen .
The offending file symsnap.sys.
Probably the new M.a.j. of Windows 7 ( 64-bit ) cause conflict .
If there is a patch I hope to be informed .
Thank you

My norton 360 v6
I bought my norton 360v6 for 2 years and paid by transfer .
I have received an email about the download but as I &apos;m not an expert I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s properly done , I don &apos;t know what to do because when I click it says to wait but it seems to be taking ages , I don &apos;t know if there is anyone who can help me , please ?
Unable to install update 19.5 by live update .
I have always managed to solve my problems by myself but this time it seems that it is unable to install an update with live update .
On Windows 7 64-bit , I do the necessary updates manually but the version stays as 19.5 no sign of 19.2 .
I should like to upgrade to have the Norton toolbar which in my case , is for the moment incompatible with firefox 10 .
Thank you !

Re : 1 Update failed = &quot; NIS product update &quot; on NIS12 for XP
I was using NIS11 .
No , I never do updates via the centre , I always bought the CD , although it &apos;s been a few years now ( NB : For reasons of payment via Internet , I cannot do the update using the centre ) .
Re : 1 Update failed = &apos; NIS product update &quot; on NIS12 with XP
Your Norton product is up to date .
The latest version of the Norton product is already installed on your computer .
That is the answer from the Update Center !
I have just made a manual LiveUpdate , 4 updates were available --- &gt; 3 have installed normally , except the 4E : &quot; NIS product update &quot; ! ! !

Attention ! For your information there is no automatic or manual Liveupdate .
Hi all ,
Don &apos;t panic if from the middle of the morning you don &apos;t see updates using LiveUpdate , even if you do it manually , the same if you manually download the Database of virus definitions .
Apparently there must be a problem with the Symantec servers .
But you are still protected .
All the processors available nowadays are 64-bit .....
the 64-bit is faster and capable of managing more complex pages .

Re : Firefox and the Norton Toolbar
Hi ,
I have just upgraded to firefox 11 and my Norton toolbar has vanished . When go into my Add-ons I am told that it is unavailable with firefox 11,
Can anyone help me ?
Thank you
Re : Re : Firefox and the Norton Toolbar
Yes .
Version Number is given in the link that I put in my first answer .
You make a manual LiveUpdate , restart and verify the version .
If it &apos;s not yet the latest version , redo a manual LiveUpdate and restart .
In any case , if the program is update , it will ask to restart .
Re : Re : Firefox and the Norton Toolbar
I shall send you a snapshot .
Re : Re : Firefox and the Norton Toolbar
In FF 11 , the Toolbar is currently unavailable .
No problem with IE 8 and 9 .
After two updates ( since you changed into English the 1st time ) , to make sure , use the opportunity to make a backup of your logins , it can be useful .
See demos
Re : Re : Firefox and the Norton Toolbar
I have checked I have still got them but I will do a backup , do you think that it will take a long time before it &apos;s right again ?
It &apos;s been a while that the norton toolbar works in firefox 11 .
Even with the previous version there was no problem .
All your configurations are a bit weird !

Good evening to all
In fact , without expecting too much , Windows Defender ends up disabled when installing NIS .

Re : Windows Defender compatible with NIS 2012 ?
use him as the path to have access to the services and :
Control Panel and then system and security and then you click on Administrative Tools and after that on services
How can it not be installed since I receive updates regularly ?
What mistigry means , is that even defending yourself and disabling windows it will ask for the update .

Thank you for the patience ...
Re : Windows Defender compatible with NIS 2012 ?
For the control panel you have to be in &quot; display by category &quot; .
This seems to me to be the default and I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll be thinking about putting it into &quot; big icons &quot;
I &apos;ll do it again for you .

1- For reasons of confidentiality , in the screenshot , have you got your email address ?
2- What Norton product ?
3-Do you use an email program ?
If so which and do these windows appear even when the email program is closed ?
This would mean that you don &apos;t have a dedicated IP but variable .
The IP must have changed , check .
When you switch off the router , wait at least 30s to 1 minute before reconnecting .
But it doesn &apos;t alter your problem and I &apos;ve got no idea .
I have just opened some other links but ? ? ?

Hello , since I am changed to NIS version 19.7.0.9 , after each daily automatic live update I lose my internet connection .
The only way to find it is to restart the PC ( on Vista with Firefox ) .
Thats pretty irritating ... Is this a known issue and if so what &apos;s the solution ?
Thank you to those who could help me .

Re : NIS 2012 Version 19.7.1.5
Hi ,
I have also had problems with updates ( the same as Liliana _ Gaspar ) , and I have also received 19.7.1.5 version files
Just in passing , there is more info here .
Re : Loss of internet connection after every live update
Hi ,
You should go into &quot; Manage network connections &quot; , see here ( 4th image ) .
&quot; After each daily automatic live update &quot; &gt; it depends on which updates because there are several per day .
It was following a manual LiveUpdate ?
Logout of the antivirus
I renewed the antivirus Internet Security 2012 last November , for a period of one year .
My antivirus worked up until a month ago and since then it shows that I need to renew my subscription , my antivirus is now disabled .
I have re-entered my product key but it doesn &apos;t work .
Other connected computers on the same antivirus at the same time are still working .
What should I do ?
Re : antivirus deconnection
My antivirus has expired before the expiry date .
Is it because I changed hard disk a short time before ?

Re : Scans whilst NIS 2012 is idle and returns to office ?
Hi &lt; URL &gt; ,
Well then , right click ( on the norton icon in notifications ) and select &quot; Turn on Silent Mode &quot;
Thank you for the tip I will test it next time .
However , It doesn &apos;t say if it is really the Norton scan causing this return in the desktop .
In any case it &apos;s one of the avenues to try .

Re : Install 2 licenses for Norton Internet Security 2012
Hi ,
Originally , the license is for 1 year .
Even if you have 1 license for 3 PC &apos;s , when you activate a 2nd PC , it starts from the date of the first activation .
Your 2nd license , even if this is not the same , cannot have the days added .
How many days of the subscription do you have left , and is the 2nd license different from the first ?
Identity safe
I &apos;m back ,
I don &apos;t have autofill anymore ( login , password ) on certain sites .
A little idea ?
Re : Identity safe
@ reggie88
&quot; I have had the same problem since updating to ed 360 v6 &quot; &gt; were you already on v6 or is it following the patch program deployed recently ?
Identity Safe may not work with some sites .
Especially those on HTTPS and it also depends on the design of sites .
In the browser , you can report the issue using the Identity Safe toolbar menu . ﻿

Re : Spyware &quot; Babylon &quot; not detected .
No , I &apos;m certainly not confusing it with CCleaner , I am very familiar with it .
If I gave you the info on adwcleaner , it &apos;s because I followed the suggested link ...
That malwarebytes has detected and removed .
Therefore no , it &apos;s not a good cleaner , on the contrary ; It tries to get you to install the Babylon toolbar by any means possible , moreover it adds its own Adware .

Re : Can we install Identity safe on 2 search engines ?
Hi ,
When you install NIS or N360 , the Norton with Identity Safe toolbar installs automatically and is compatible with 32-bit browsers &gt; IE , Chrome and FireFox .
To back up your logins , see the demo .
Re : Norton Internet Security
There is no need to turn off the antivirus if you managed to download it .
When you execute Adwcleaner and you click on &quot; search &quot; , a file is created .

Hi Jackyy ,

Hi ,
Thank you for the answer , I ticked &quot; remove &quot; and I checked the settings but nothing has changed .
On google the problem still appears .
Thank you
1 / OK , restart adwcleaner and then uninstall .
Tell me which extensions you have .
OK
Check in add / remove programs if there is not something marked bccool .
Start / control panel / programmes and functionality
A list appears , check to see if there isn &apos;t something marked bccool , if there is then uninstall it .
Re : Norton PC &amp; Mac
Thank you very much for your reply .
You &apos;ve figured out the situation perfectly .
But if it is possible to do this upgrade now , I &apos;ll go for it .
I work with my Mac laptop so I would prefer to be protected by an antivirus as soon as possible .
Thank you in advance for your time .
Re : Norton PC &amp; Mac
Hi ,
There may be a solution for you , but as it is a somewhat special case , it is better to contact technical support directly ( I would advise you to use the chat option for a faster response ) .
I will send you a private message for more information .

Hi ! !
Thank you ! ! !
I couldn &apos;t say which version I installed on my phone , but it was free .
Sorry to tell you that currently I have an Internet problem ( ? )
Norton 360 does not start .
Often Norton is not open .
Or that I try to open it by clicking the icon , and it doesn &apos;t open .
Also , I have just had a message that the open Internet page contains a virus .
I checked Norton immediately , and it wasn &apos;t open and wouldn &apos;t open .
Thank you !
Re : Norton PC &amp; Mac
Hi ,
I am in the same boat as Grunwalsky and I would like to know the procedure to extend the Norton 360 licence currently installed on my PC to my Mac as well .
I installed in the past a Mac version of Norton Antivirus but my subscription has run out .
Before renewing it , I would like to know if my license for Norton 360 for my PC can also cover my Mac .
Thank you in advance
Hi ,
In your case brunopel2 no , however you can contact the customer support to explain and see if you can change your Norton 360 to Norton 360 Everywhere .
At the same time contact the Norton chat .

Re : Putting Norton on another PC but with a different email address .
Hi ,
It &apos;s impossible because your key is linked to the account with the email address that was registered upon first purchase and which allows you to be recognised .
The only thing you can do is to change the email address in your account but you will still only have one email address to recognise the account .
Then use your email address on your sister &apos;s computer .

Hi ,
OK , mab worked hard as well .

Re : Scan a file command line
To be more efficient , you should update your Norton product ( the procedure is free ) : Go to your Norton product interface -- &gt; Click on the Support tab &quot; -- &gt; Download the latest version.Note : Remember to do a manual live update at the end of the installation . Then , if I have understood correctly , you would like to scan a file on the Internet ?

Hi , put your Norton product into aggressive mode , and then run a full system scan ! Here &apos;s a Tutorial to put your N360 product in aggressive mode . Once this is done , don &apos;t forget to put your Norton product back into the normal mode .

Good evening Apolyon ,
Thank you for taking the time to answer me .
In the tutorial , to change Norton into aggressive mode , I assume that the images three and four are to show the changes I have to perform , unfortunately they are no longer available , Sorry , but as a result , I don &apos;t have any information for &apos; automatic protection &apos; or the changes for &apos; scan and risks &apos; .

The product will be attached to the Norton Account once it is enabled .
How was the product aquired ?
Via the Norton online store or another way ?
Thank you ,
Hi Thearkofjo ,
I think that problem is because the MBR hasn &apos;t been copied .
It is better to copy the HDD onto SSD using the tool : Copy hard drive , available on Norton Ghost .
I recommend you follow the steps on this tutorial .

Hi ,
The N360 key is not valid for NIS .
If you still have a valid key for NIS , you can uninstall N360 and reinstall NIS .
If you turn off the backup , is the computer still slow ?
N360 is more comprehensive software that NIS , I think the best thing to do is to try to resolve the problem so you can make the most of the investment already made .

I would say that you are on the scanning screen , apart from that I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know much about NIS 2012 .

Good evening nicolarte ,
If I have understood the previous thread , you &apos;re talking about a &quot; cohabitation &quot; between N360 and Defender .
Correct ?
Is Defender disabled in your current configuration ?
If not , it probably should be and then try and reinstall N360 .
The latest version is the 6.3.0.14 .

As Ali said it needs an update of Norton 360 to fix this bug ..
Since this update the task bar for norton 360 seems to have stopped crashing .. for those who see this post , ensure you completely update Norton which will fix this bug .
Note that the Norton task bar will always display the 2012.5.5.11 version , this is normal .

Re : uKash not detected
Thank you for this link .
Not really very reassuring , it must be said . Roughly this means Norton doesn &apos;t protect against everything .
So if I have a virus then it &apos;s not Norton &apos;s fault because Norton has another tool ( which I don &apos;t have ) that would have found it ...
It is a bit like having an umbrella with a hole in it .

I have just seen the last sentence : Norton is not an anti-virus .
Then here &apos;s a question : Norton protects what ? ? ?
Information regarding the Norton Removal Tool 2013 .
Where can I find the Norton Removal tool 2013 , if there is one ?
Because , as I have already said in another message , NRT asks me to uninstall NIS 2013 before using it .
This morning , my computer has started , but after an automatic Windows update ( I do not know why and I do not know what ) .
In any case , it is working well , and Norton Internet Security is still running .
I hope that it will keep working .
Hi ,
Oh Ok , I didn &apos;t know .

It says you can try uninstalling Norton with revouninstaller , There is a tutorial here : see parts 1 to 3 .

Re : Norton PC checkup
Hi ,
I had an older version of Norton PC Checkup on my PC and it was French . I installed the new version ( version 3.0 ) today ; the entire installation process was in French but once the software is installed ... it is all in English ... ! ! !
This new version has nothing to do with the old one , it is completely revised .... I think it only exists in English .... ! !

I can &apos;t perform a recovery on a 64-bit computer .
Hi ,
I have to perform a recovery on a 64-bit computer but the creation of Symantec Recovery Disk can &apos;t be completed because it &apos;s missing the Mini WAN iekv2 32-bit driver
I cannot find this driver online ? Can someone send it to me ?
Thank you Alain
Tested with 3 browsers ( Chrome , Internet Explorer and Firefox ) it works very well , with automatic integration after the installation with Chrome and IE .
However , for Firefox , you must install the &quot; Lastpass &quot; module and then turn it on so it can be integreted in the browser .

Re : Norton Internet Security Error : 3048 , 3
Good evening , The problem is without doubt due to an overload of the Symantec servers . You have the latest version of Norton . Nevertheless , here is the procedure to follow to unblock the situation : - Open the NIS interface 2013 &gt; Launch Live updates until such time as it doesn &apos;t find any more updates . Restart the computer . This should resolve your problem. good evening .

Re : Problem with NIS 2013
Hi phildariane
Yes , thank you , I installed silverlight 5 , but I also have registry problems related to silverlight &amp; Eurosport player ...
But this is not the forum for this part .....
Hundreds of millions of Windows PC users do not really have anything to do with ergonomics , Metro may be tolerable on a smartphone but absolutely not for serious business use .
So if Microsoft intends to bully users into using Metro , companies will stick with Windows 7 for ten years as they did with XP .
Symantec would do well to remember .

False Norton message ?
Hi ,
I have just received a so-called Norton message ( see attachment ) .
It seemed a bit bizarre because I checked that Norton did an live update 3 minutes ago and I am wondering if it is a virus or something a bit nasty that &apos;s going around .
I closed the message .
Was I right ?

Re : Connection problem to backup center .
Pending a notification from Symantec about this problem , I have managed to resolve the problem by uninstalling from my 6 machines using two different accounts , and reinstalling NIS 2012 , which works very well for the Identity Safe function .

Re : Happy Birthday ! Norton French-speaking forum !
Happy birthday to the Forum , which is really very useful .
I have lost count of the number of times that I was able to resolve a problem by reading through the suggestions ( a real gold mine ) .
Re : Re : Snapshot error % 1
Given the random nature of my backups , I have dropped it .

I have lost approximately 70 € .

Re : Attempted Intrusion from mass injection website .
Hi ,
Does it only happen on this site or on other sites as well ? ? .
I quote Liliana _ Gaspar : &quot; The problem has been reported and we are working to resolve it . &quot;

Good evening ,
Yes , don &apos;t worry , don &apos;t trust the maintenance centre too much .

Good evening ,
Personally I had the same problem on my wife &apos;s laptop on which I had installed W8 , I uninstalled and reinstalled NIS and since then the error message hasn &apos;t appeared .
I did the reinstallation more to ease my conscience , as I &apos;m sure that NIS was working normally .
On my own PC which is also running W8 I &apos;ve had no concerns of this kind so far .

Good evening , yes if SpyBot is enabled in Resident , it can cause conflicts . I will be clear with you : Spybot is completely unnecessary , pointless , and obsolete .

Re : SONAR Protection Disabled
Great , thank you Apolyon , my issue was fixed by this solution :
&#91; &gt; &gt; Open Norton . &gt; &gt; Launch several live updates until no more are available . &gt; &gt; Restart the machine . &#93;
What strikes me as strange is that the updates were done everyday ...
Personally I find it incredible that Widows 8 comes out and suddenly even programmers like you don &apos;t know how to fix a little licence storage problem . As jrudaz rightly says , after 30 days you find something else .

I have just had an intrusion attempt by the Mass Injection Website on my PC with NIS. www.planeur.net site does not open but the IP address of this site does not appear in the list of blocked computers by Autoblock , therefore it &apos;s impossible to access or unlock .

Re : Slow loading .
Hi ,
If you are using Identity Safe ( Backup centre ) , make a backup of your logins .
1- You will uninstall it with Norton Removal Tool .
Restart as requested at the end of the uninstall .
2- Install NIS 2013 , do a manual LiveUpdate , restart and redo a manual LiveUpdate .
Patches are being done for problems with loading Norton on startup ( different threads seen on the US Forum ) .
Re : Norton Family : Unable to make parent connections since windows XP update .
Same with windows7 , whether through NIS or directly on the Norton Family site .
Still the same error for several days .

On the other hand a huge crash while applying the Windows 8 patch , restart unsuccessful and reset needed .
Hi , my problem is also &quot; intrusion attempt mass injection website &quot;
But I don &apos;t know if it was a false positive or not .
In any case I don &apos;t understand why Norton Safe Web gave me a safe link and then Norton 360 immediately blocked it 3 times in a row ( I only went there once ) .
Who is right ?
Norton safe web or norton 360
Thank you
Good evening
Unfortunately it is more complicated for me on my corporate network , I am not an administrator of my PC and the Vista operating system has an additional layer , it is therefore very difficult to know .
How do you contact the SEP Support ?
In any case , I &apos;ve had no more hassles for 2 days with NIS2012 with the singnature in question enabled .

Re : XML scan error appears on Firefox .
The problem started with the latest version of NIS that fixed a bug with Windows XP . ( Norton crash during Liveupdate and others ) ..
I had the previous version before that crashed on one PC and not on the other , and I used FF15 ; Identity Safe worked without problems ..
Yes , after a liveupdate , installing a patch , I &apos;ve got the same problem that I mentioned the 02 November ( first message in the list ) .... My conclusion ; there was a problem that got worse with FF17 but the patch is for the original problem !
( We can nevertheless use the saved logins ) So perhaps there will be a real fix in the coming days ?
And will we get an extra months subscription , to compensate ?
Unexpected deactivation of NIS 2013 .
Hi ,
For the last 4 days , my NIS 2013 disables itself unexpectedly ( Auto-protect , ... ) , the correction doesn &apos;t happen and the manual reactivation does not work .

What is the solution to deal with this problem once and for all ?

Re : Disconnect an external drive
I have re-read my reply and I wonder if the following was clear : The uninstall was just to confirm that the problem comes from NIS , it wasn &apos;t a solution in itself .
I can do other research but as far as troubleshooting is concerned , if we can start by proving that the problem comes from the antivirus we would know if it is worthwhile continuing along this path .

If that &apos;s the case , if I didn &apos;t have any more installs to download , what could I have done ?
Indeed , I only have one more install possible in the next three 3 months .
Thank you in advance .
Re : Slow loading .
Hi Phildariane ,
Thank you for the answer .
My three computers do not often spend more than 15 days before a defragmentation and the new HP in question has very few programs on it .
To you and to all the members of the Forum I wish a merry Christmas and a happy New Year .

Hi ,
I have marked everything regarding the versions .
The N ° you indicated is from Norton 2013 .
Follow this thread to reinstall the 2012 version .
Using your current key .
Hi lamant21,
The problem does not seem widespread - at least chefo and some others seem to have access .
In your case , it may be faster to contact support to ensure that you make the renewal in time .

Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : XML parsing error appears on Firefox
Firefox or Norton ! Is that the question ? This problem doesn &apos;t exist with the first version of NIS 2013 and Firefox 15 or 16 . The version of NIS 2013 that shipped end October , that corrected the Windows XP problem ( Norton crashing in various situations that LiveUpdate with NIS ) this problem appeared on Firefox 15 and later versions .
Where does the error come from ?
Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : XML parsing error appears on Firefox
I find it unbelievable ! Compensation shouldn &apos;t have to be asked for . Norton customer service should have automatically offered it to it &apos;s customers with this problem . It is not for Firefox to adapt to Norton but Norton which should adapt to a change in Firefox !
Re : Windows Live Mail error message with Norton360 .

I &apos;m a year past the expiry date of the 2012 version , and the update that I was offered was the 2013 version ... we &apos;re chasing our tail here , no ?
Sincerely ;
From 2006 onwards , a valid key is valid for all versions of the same product .
For 2013 versions , patches are expected for sometime in January , well ... we hope .

If someone on the forum has the answer to this problem , it would be great if you let us know !
Unless you found a solution in the meantime , Blandine ?
Yes , the bar is active and configured to be visible on firefox .
In fact , the bar is visible and active , but only the buttons &quot; Norton &quot; , &quot; Home ( pictogram ) &quot; , &quot; SafeWeb &quot; and &quot; Share &quot; , like on the screen shot from Guillaume1024 ( 1st message ) .
However , the buttons &quot; backup centre open / closed &quot; and &quot; connection Wizard &quot; are not visible ( and therefore not active ) .
Sincerely .
OK agreed , thank you !

And check that Norton toolbar is ticked .
Did it fix it your problem ?

What I have a little difficulty understanding , is when we buy the software in question do we becomes the owner and we also have 1 , 2 or 3 years maintenance OR when we get to the end of the subscription we simply cannot use the software unless we pay for more time .

Thank you for the helping hand
Re : Problem NIS the 20 / 03 / 2013
New problem with the launch of Quick Scan !
Norton is becoming a real pain , you have to ask if we are really protected !
Re : Problem NIS the 20 / 03 / 2013

There is no change , the default is still present .
Sitting in front of the screen waiting for it to change , I have just enough time to read part of message : &quot; Norton has done &quot; ... , then the message clears .

Hi Gedeon48,

Re : A virtual keyboard with Norton products .
Hi chefo ,
Either the software is listed as malicious in our database and blocked by the antivirus and antispyware technology or its actions are detected by SONAR which blocks it .
And for logins on Internet there has Identity Safe .

I think that Norton is part of the problem , because concerning the address you listed , I have tried to launch the address you marked and it goes nowhere with either Google or IE .
Re : Norton IS 2013 unauthorized Access taskmgr.exe ?
Yes , it &apos;s exactly the same thing .
So we don &apos;t know what it is then .
But it is linked to a Norton bug .
Is there something to be done ? Reinstall maybe ( Norton or even the PC ) ? Or is it nothing serious and we can wait ?
Re : Fault corrected successfully by AutoFix .
Hi ,
I have also seen this problem when updating Firefox 20 .
I find ( this is my personal opinion ) that Norton has a huge number of problems with the 2013 version , in fact the v20.x , I hope that the next version ( 21.x ) will not have so many problems .

Firewall
I cannot access ADSL tv .
I believe that the difficulty is with the firewall .
My windows firewall is disabled to take advantage of the Norton protection , but I do not know how to make an exception for ADSL TV access .
Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me fix this problem .
Re : NIS 2013 - Toolbar - Problems on XP
I &apos;ve think I &apos;ve done it . I clicked on the Norton window and there was an option to deactivate it . The best part is that I can still use identity safe .
Good evening dear lady .
