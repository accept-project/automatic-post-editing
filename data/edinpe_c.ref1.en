Re : How do you connect to the backup centre automatically .
Hi ,
I see that the option was there on the first versions of NIS / N360 2013 , but since the last update it &apos;s gone .
I &apos;ll find out and get back to you .
Thank you and good day ,
Automatic verification of removable device .
Here is what brought me here , after inserting a USB key , a virus crashed my PC .
An idea is that all removable devices are really checked as they are connected .

Re : Norton GHOST for WINDOWS 8
Hi ,
There is an error on the Symantec site that I have already pointed out .
@ BGreg92 - I think you have had a refund like you mentioned in your message .
Please don &apos;t hesitate if you still need help .
This is also an official Symantec message concerning this subject :

Re : Sending a ( small ) number of e-mails .
Hi ,
Could you give us a little more information about your problem , including :
- What Norton product do you have and which version .
- What software do you use for e-mails .
- What type of blockage have you encountered ( as an example , you can add a screenshot to your reply ) .
Thank you very much !
Hi bobrieguyane ,

Re : Norton Family : Unable to make parent connection since Windows XP update !
Hi ,

Re : Firefox 17 available and Re : Re : Firefox and the Norton Toolbar

Hi , maybe I went a little too quickly ...
Symantec end point doesn &apos;t work at the office so I shall work at home this evening with NIS 2012 , I &apos;ll keep you updated .
Re : Slow loading .
Hi ,
If you are using Identity Safe ( Backup centre ) , make a backup of your logins .
1- You will uninstall it with Norton Removal Tool .
Restart as requested at the end of the uninstall .
2- Install NIS 2013 , do a manual LiveUpdate , restart and redo a manual LiveUpdate .
Patches are being done for problems with loading Norton on startup ( different threads seen on the US Forum ) .
Re : Norton Family : Unable to make parent connections since windows XP update .
Same with windows7 , whether through NIS or directly on the Norton Family site .
Still the same error for several days .
&quot; Sorry , An error has occurred on the server . &quot;

On the other hand a huge crash while applying the Windows 8 patch , restart unsuccessful and reset needed .
Hi , my problem is also &quot; intrusion attempt mass injection website &quot;
But I don &apos;t know if it was a false positive or not .
In any case I don &apos;t understand why Norton Safe Web gave me a safe link and then Norton 360 immediately blocked it 3 times in a row ( I only went there once ) .
Who is right ?
Norton safe web or norton 360
Thank you
Good evening
Unfortunately it is more complicated for me on my corporate network , I am not an administrator of my PC and the Vista operating system has an additional layer , it is therefore very difficult to know .
How do you contact the SEP Support ?
In any case , I &apos;ve had no more hassles for 2 days with NIS2012 with the singnature in question enabled .

Re : XML scan error appears on Firefox .
The problem started with the latest version of NIS that fixed a bug with Windows XP . ( Norton crash during Liveupdate and others ) ..
I had the previous version before that crashed on one PC and not on the other , and I used FF15 ; Identity Safe worked without problems ..
Yes , after a liveupdate , installing a patch , I &apos;ve got the same problem that I mentioned the 02 November ( first message in the list ) .... My conclusion ; there was a problem that got worse with FF17 but the patch is for the original problem !
( We can nevertheless use the saved logins ) So perhaps there will be a real fix in the coming days ?
And will we get an extra months subscription , to compensate ?
Unexpected deactivation of NIS 2013 .
Hi ,
For the last 4 days , my NIS 2013 disables itself unexpectedly ( Auto-protect , ... ) , the correction doesn &apos;t happen and the manual reactivation does not work .
The only solution I have found is to re-install the product ... but I am not going to do that forever because I still have more than 330 days to run on this product !
What is the solution to deal with this problem once and for all ?

Re : Disconnect an external drive
I have re-read my reply and I wonder if the following was clear : The uninstall was just to confirm that the problem comes from NIS , it wasn &apos;t a solution in itself .
I can do other research but as far as troubleshooting is concerned , if we can start by proving that the problem comes from the antivirus we would know if it is worthwhile continuing along this path .

Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : XML parsing error appears on Firefox

Good evening Michel _ 1108,
If all goes well , I think that it shouldn &apos;t be much longer to wait for the patch ( I can &apos;t promise anything though ) .
Meanwhile , I have found this post from another client that had found a way to copy / paste from word which seemed to resolve a similar problem to yours : Intermittent problem with recognition of Identity Safe password .

Re : The Norton toolbar in my Google web browser has disappeared .

If the problem reappears , I will definitely let you know .

There is however an important detail in my computer freezing problem that differs from the computer freeze referred to in Liliana &apos;s solution .

Re : Blue screen caused by SYMEFA.SYS in WIN XP
This problem does come from Norton .
I have to restart in my XP sp3 in safe mode .
Delete the files &quot; Symefa &quot; and Magic , after that no more problems .
I then reinstall Norton and get an alert on the file SYMEFA.SYS and the blue screen .
For professional reasons I can &apos;t work with a PC that goes wrong .
I hope that this problem can be resolved because otherwise I have no other choice than to use the competition .

Simply because it works with IE , Norton would block the images on both .

Re : Recovery of data backed up to hard disk with Norton 360 on a new PC .
Norton 360 doesn &apos;t make disk images like other software .
You should be able to choose which file you want to download / copy onto your current computer .

Re : My Norton internet security does not seem to work
It seems my issue is resolved .
I did a system restore at a later date .
Norton needed to be amended , but everything works now .
It is as if there had been a &apos; conflict &apos; with the last update from windows .
Hi Minimo ,
Happy that your problem is solved !
Could you indicate it by choosing &quot; Accept as solution &quot; on your last message ?

Hi Kazou ,
The second part of the patch was distributed this week , but the third and last part is still missing .
No specific problem on Windows 8 with me .

360 Identity Safe and Skype connection and Norton toolbar
Hi ,
I &apos;m finding that when connecting to Skype , Identity Safe does not work for managing logins .
You need to enter your ID manually .
There is no Norton toolbar either .
In short , there is no interaction between Norton and Skype at this level .
If not , does anyone know if it &apos;s coming .
Thank you in advance

Furthermore , for your information . I do not usually write or respond without thinking : I re-read the post dedicated to this update before answering .

Re : Norton toolbar
Apparently your Norton bar is enabled in &quot; Firefox &quot; ( orange box top left ) &gt; Complementary modules ) .
However , have you verified that the toolbar is configured to be displayed under Firefox .
To do that , go to &quot; Firefox ( orange box top left ) &gt; &gt; Options &quot;
And check that Norton toolbar is ticked .
Did it fix it your problem ?
Sincerely

Re : Norton toolbar
PS : I am surprised by the version number of your Norton Toolbar .
What Norton product are you using ?

Re : Patch 20.3.0.36 not received
Hi ,
I &apos;d like to point out that I wasn &apos;t saying anything , my question was just to find out where you saw it , that &apos;s all .
That is precisely why I asked this , because I think it is strange that they ask to uninstall a product for a patch .
It was nothing have with you , or anyone else other , except Norton technicians .

Satisfaction with NORTON by Symantec 360
Hi , I &apos;ll put in my two penny worth , Norton is improving over the years , this means that we can rely on quality products , It &apos;s a paid product but the results are evident , and as we also have a community forum dedicated to Norton by Symantec , we &apos;re not short of opportunities for additional help .

Purchase of Symantec System Recovery 2013 .
If I understand correctly , we can opt for a 1 , 2 or 3 year maintenance package. either in essential or basic mode .
What I have a little difficulty understanding , is when we buy the software in question do we becomes the owner and we also have 1 , 2 or 3 years maintenance OR when we get to the end of the subscription we simply cannot use the software unless we pay for more time .
Thank you for clarifying this point .
